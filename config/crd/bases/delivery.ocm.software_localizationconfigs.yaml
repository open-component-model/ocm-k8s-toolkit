                            A simple example of this is the TransformationTypeRepository,
                            which extracts the registry portion of an image reference:

                            Example:
                              map:
                                transformation:
                                  type: Repository

                            The default TransformationType is TransformationTypeImage, which extracts the full image reference.
                            For more information on individual TransformationType's, see their respective documentation.
